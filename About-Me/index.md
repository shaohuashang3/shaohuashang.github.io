I'm a graduate student studying in Stevens Institute of Technology. I'm in computer science major. I've researched Land coastline networks (CLNs),
and learned skills of Web Programming and Data Mining. Currently, I am exploring React framework in node.js and web analytics in python.

When not programming, I am a runner and country music enthusiast.
