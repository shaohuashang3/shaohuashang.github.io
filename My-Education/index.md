**Stevens Institute of Technology** (SIT) is a private, coeducational research university located in [Hoboken, New Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoboken,_New_Jersey), United States. The university also has a satellite location in Washington, D.C.. Incorporated in 1870, it is one of the oldest technological universities in the United States, and was the first college in America solely dedicated to mechanical engineering. The campus encompasses Castle Point, the highest point in Hoboken, and several other buildings around the city.

## Shanghai Maritime University

![SMULogo](../images/smu_1.jpg)

**Shanghai Maritime University** (SMU; Chinese: 上海海事大学, 原名上海海运学院, 吴淞商船学校) is a public university in Shanghai, People's Republic of China. Shanghai Maritime University is multidisciplinary with six fields of study: Engineering, Management, Economics, Literature, Science and Law. It is one of the best Chinese universities for specialization in maritime, shipping and transport education.

My undergraduate major is Network Engineering. I've continually made a steady progress in my undergraduante study. I mainly learned software development language, computer network, network construction & management. And I tried to gain as much hands-on experience as possible by frequenting the research labs on campus. 

In the last year, I carried out my final year project (FYP) from February to
June 2015. My FYP topic is about network planning on how to exploit mobile
personal communication networks such as WiMax and LTE to construct a coastal line network to provide Internet service to ships or vessels moving in water areas near the coast line. Frankly speaking, this topic is challenging since few relevant research can be found in the literature. The requirement of my FYP is to set a simulation test with the Exata simulation package for my proposal. In order to make the simulation scenario close to the reality, I went to the Yangsan Harbor(Shanghai, China), about 32 km away from the campus, to investigate the real shipping lines. Finally, my FYP was graded as "excellent" which is honored only to about ten of more than 400 students graduating from the college each year.
